# Data Description
The symbols (characters and numerals) in these datasets were collected from 130 individuals of different age, sex and professions, There are two datasets: i) the set of handwritten Bengali compound characters (IUBCCdb), ii) the set of handwritten Bengali modifiers (IUBMCdb). Some details of these datasets are given below:
 > - We performed a statistics on the uses of compound characters, and we ranked the charcters based their frequency of occurrence, and we found that there are 87 most commnonly used (>=5%) compound characters.
> - Every volunteer was asked to write these characters on a A4 plane sheet paper.
> - The purpose of this study was disclosed to the volunteers, and no special instruction was provided to them. The volunteers gave full consent to use these data for research.
> - There are 100 male and 30 female volunteers participated in writing these characters
> - The volunteers belong to the professions of students, govt. private job holders, and shop keepers
> - The age of the volunteers range from 13 to 55 years
> - These sheet containing the characters was scanned by a flatbed scanner and saved as 256 color (BMP) file
> - Finally, the characters were segmenteded and stored in the relevant datasets as 256 bmp file
> - There are 9140 samples of 87 classes in the IUBCCdd compound characters dataset
> - There are 7909 samples of 13 classes in the IUBMCdd modifiers dataset
>
# Files & File structure
> - Total Uncompressed size 1.01 GB on the disk
> - Total compressed size 184 MB on the disk
> - In the IUBCCdb, there are 87 subfolders corresponding to each compound character class. 
> - In the IUBMCdb, there are 13 subfolders corresponding to 13 modifiers classes labeled from 0 to 12
> - In both datasets, the samples of each characters were labeled as integer numbers.
